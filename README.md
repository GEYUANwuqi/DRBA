# Distance Ratio Based Adjuster for Animeinterp
> **Abstractï¼š** This project serves as a control mechanism for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) networks specifically tailored for anime.
> By calculating the DistanceRatioMap, it adjusts the frame interpolation strategies for spatiotemporally nonlinear and linear regions,
> thereby preserving the original pace and integrity of the characters while avoiding distortions common in frame interpolation.
