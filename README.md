# Fast Character Lossless Anime Video Frame Interpolation
Using the characteristics of animation repetitive beats, avoid areas that are difficult to compensate. Add smooth to the background, also ensure that the characters are not damaged as much as possible.

**Supported interpolation algorithms:**
> Any vfi algorithm that can pass a timestep map of shape 1, 1, h, w and calc timestep map by an optical flow algorithm
> 
> The code and the following demo demonstrates the combination of FastFlowNet + RIFE
